# Spatial distributions of Steller sea lions for Atlantis GOA

This code produces distribution maps of Steller sea lions for Atlantis GOA. The maps are crude approximations based on aerial data collected by the National Marine Mammal Laboratory (see [Fritz et al. 2016](https://repository.library.noaa.gov/view/noaa/10474/noaa_10474_DS1.pdf) and previous reports from the same authors) for Alaska, and data from [DFO](https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/0083baf1-8145-4207-a84f-3d85ef2943a5) for British Columbia.  

Distributions are built based on assumed dispersal radius of animals from the colonies, which is different between summer and winter (animals tend to stay closer to the rookery when there are pups, and will leave the haulouts for longer periods in the winter). See code for details.  

At the moment we are assuming that juveniles and adults have the same spatial distributions.
